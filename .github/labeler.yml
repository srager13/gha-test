# but we choose not to in this project)
enable:
  prs: true

# Automated comment on the PR generated by the auto-labeler

  prs: |
    Thanks for the contribution!
    The auto-labeler github action has applied any labels matching special text in your title and description.

    Please review the labels and make any necessary changes.

# Labels is an object where:
# - keys are labels
# - values are objects of { include: [ pattern ], exclude: [ pattern ] }
#    - pattern must be a valid regex, and is applied globally to
#      title + description of issues and/or prs (see enabled config above)
#    - 'include' patterns will associate a label if any of these patterns match
#    - 'exclude' patterns will ignore this label if any of these patterns match
#
# For KPP, we match on the checklist for the type of PR:
labels:
  'Breaking':
    include:
      - '\- \[[xX]\] Breaking'
    exclude: []
  'bugfix':
    include:
      - '\- \[[xX]\] Bug Fix'
    exclude: []
  'new feature':
    include:
      - '\- \[[xX]\] New Feature'
    exclude: []
  'documentation':
    include:
      - '\- \[[xX]\] Documentation Update'
    exclude: []
